/**
 * this package offers Robot state estimation using sensor Odometry, and path following using the Adaptive pure pursuit controller. Most of the math and algorithms here were implemented by team 254, but Ohm offers a more accessible interface to apply them. The ohm implementation of the APPS controller can be found in {@link system.drive.PathFollowingSystem.java}
